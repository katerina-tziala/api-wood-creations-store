# :rocket: Wood Creations Store RESTful API

A RESTful API for an online wood creations store.

The database schema, the data contracts and the exposed API endpoints can be found in the [REQUIREMENTS.md](https://github.com/katerina-tziala/api-wood-creations-store/blob/master/REQUIREMENTS.md)

## Prerequisites

Node version >= 12.13.0
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) or [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

## Technologies

Hereâ€™s a high level list of the technologies used for this app:

- **For Development:** [Node.js v16.13.0](https://nodejs.org/en/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [PostgreSQL v14](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

- **For Testing:** [Jasmine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jasmine)

- **For Code Styling:** [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)

## Running the App

1. Fork and clone this repository

2. To install the dependencies of the app, run in the project directory `npm install` or `npm i`

3. In the root directory of the project create a **_.env_** file based on the [example.env](https://github.com/katerina-tziala/api-wood-creations-store/blob/master/example.env)
   
   The default values of the environment variables are already provided.

4. Set up the databases for development and testing as described in the [DATABASE_SETUP.md](https://github.com/katerina-tziala/api-wood-creations-store/blob/master/DATABASE_SETUP.md)

5. Make sure your database is up and running

6. To set up the database schema, in the project directory run: `npm run database:up`

7. To run the app, in the project directory run: `npm run dev`

## Code Quality and Testing

The commands to check the code quality and test the api must be run in the project directory.

### Code Quality

The preferred settings for the coding style of the app can be fount in the [.prettierrc](https://github.com/katerina-tziala/api-wood-creations-store/blob/master/.prettierrc) and [.eslintrc](https://github.com/katerina-tziala/api-wood-creations-store/blob/master/.eslintrc) files.

To check the code consistensy to the chosen coding style run `npm run prettier-check`.

To apply the chosen coding style run `npm run prettier`.

To lint the app run `npm run lint`.

### Testing

To test the app:

1. Make sure the database is up and running

2. Make sure the database for testing exists

3. In the project directory run `npm run test`.

## Future Improvements
- Increase test coverage by adding more tests.
- Implement email verification for the new users. Unverified users should not have access to the RESTful API.
- Implement price tracking per period for each one of the products and calculate total price of an order based on the price that the product had when the order was completed.
- Create endpoint to allow adminstrators see active orders of specified user(s).
- Create endpoint to allow adminstrators see statistics about customers' orders.
- Extend user creation endpoint to allow adminstrators create new adminstrators.
